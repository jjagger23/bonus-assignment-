This code is a C program that implements several sorting algorithms (selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, merge sort, 
and heap sort) and tracks the extra memory allocated during sorting operations. Additionally, it includes functions 
for memory allocation and deallocation, as well as parsing data from input files into integer arrays.
